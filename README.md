# McPlant-Locator

This python script takes a zip code as input and calculates the three closest McDonald's stores that are currently (as of Feb 2024) offering the McPlant veggie sandwich. Distances are calculated by lat/long so driving distances will be likely further. 

Store locations were pulled from: https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/mcplant-locations.html
